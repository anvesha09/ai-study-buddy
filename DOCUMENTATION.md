# AI Study Buddy - App Features

AI Study Buddy is a web application designed to help users study and understand documents more effectively by leveraging AI to generate summaries, answer questions, and create quizzes.

## How It Works

### Adding Your Content
The first step is to provide your study material. AI Study Buddy gives you two simple ways to do this:

1.  **Paste Text Directly:** You can copy text from anywhere and paste it directly into the content box. For example, the picture below shows notes about Photosynthesis ready to be summarized.

2.  **Upload a File:** Alternatively, you can click the **"Upload File"** button to use a document directly from your computer, like a PDF, .docx, or .txt file.

**Note:** No matter which method you choose, all the study tools work exactly the same way.

## Core Features in Detail

### 1. Summarize & Study
This tool acts as your personal speed-reader. Here's how it works:

1.  First, I added my document. As you can see, I uploaded a file named `atlassian-git-cheatsheet.pdf`.

2.  Then, I chose the **"Summarize & Study"** tool from the menu.
3.  The app immediately gave me three choices for the summary length: **Short**, **Medium**, and **Detailed**.
4.  I wanted a good overview without it being too long, so I clicked on **"Medium"** and the app instantly generated a summary.

### 2. Contextual Chat
Imagine you could talk directly to your study notes—that’s what Contextual Chat does.

1.  After loading the `atlassian-git-cheatsheet.pdf`, I switched over to the **"Contextual Chat"** tool. The AI greeted me and was ready for questions.

2.  I wanted to test my knowledge, so I typed: **"Give me 5 important questions."**
3.  The AI read my document and gave me five specific questions directly from the cheat sheet, such as "How do I initialize a new Git repository?".

### 3. Generate Quiz
This is the perfect tool to check if you've really understood the material. The Quiz Generator lets you set the number of questions and choose from four different quiz types.

* **Multiple-Choice Quiz:** The app creates questions with several possible answers, and you just have to pick the right one.

* **True/False Quiz:** The app generates statements based on your document, and you simply determine if they are true or false. It's perfect for testing your attention to detail.

* **Fill-in-the-Blanks Quiz:** This is perfect for memorizing key terms. It takes an important sentence from your notes and leaves a word out for you to recall.

* **Short Answer Quiz:** This is a true test of your knowledge because there are no hints. It asks a direct question, and you have to type the answer from scratch.

### 4. Generate Flashcards
This feature is perfect for active recall and memorization.

* **Simple to Create:** Just use the slider to choose how many flashcards you want.
* **Interactive Studying:** The app generates digital flashcards with a key term on one side and its definition on the other.
* **Click to Flip:** You can click on any card to flip it over and test yourself on key concepts.
