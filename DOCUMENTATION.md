    **How It Works: A Step-by-Step Guide**



<p id="gdcalert1" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image1.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert2">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image1.png "image_tooltip")



    This is the main dashboard of AI Study Buddy. Users begin by adding their study materials using the options on the left, such as pasting text or uploading a file. Now let’s understand the core features of this application:



* 
**Summarize & Study:** Instantly generate short, medium, or detailed summaries of your content.


* 
**Contextual Chat:** Ask questions in plain language and get answers based directly on your document.


* 
**Generate Quiz:** Create custom practice quizzes with multiple-choice, true/false, fill-in-the-blank, and short answer questions.


* 
**Generate Flashcards:** Automatically create flashcards for key terms and concepts to aid memorization.

**Choose How to Add Your Content:**



1. **Paste Text Directly: \
**You can copy text from anywhere and paste it directly into the content box on the left. For example, the picture shows how we've pasted notes about photosynthesis to be summarized.

Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert3">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image2.png "image_tooltip")




2. **Upload a File: \
**Alternatively, you can click the "Upload File" button to use a document directly from your computer, like a PDF, .docx, or .txt file**.**

    

<p id="gdcalert3" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image3.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert4">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>

**Summarize & Study**




<p id="gdcalert4" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image4.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert5">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image4.png "image_tooltip")





1. 
First, I added my document**.** As you can see in the picture, I uploaded a file named `atlassian-git-cheatsheet.pdf`.


2. 
Then, I chose the** "Summarize & Study" **tool from the menu on the left.


3. 
The app immediately gave me three choices for the summary length: **Short**, **Medium**, and **Detailed**.

    

<p id="gdcalert5" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image5.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert6">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image5.png "image_tooltip")




4. I decided I wanted a good overview without it being too long, so I clicked on** "Medium."**

    **Contextual Chat**




<p id="gdcalert6" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image6.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert7">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image6.png "image_tooltip")




1. After loading my document, the `atlassian-git-cheatsheet.pdf`, I switched over to the **"Contextual Chat"** tool.
2. The AI immediately welcomed me and said, **"Hello! I've loaded your document. Ask me anything about it."**

    

<p id="gdcalert7" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image7.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert8">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image7.png "image_tooltip")


3. I wanted to see what the most important topics in the document were. So, in the chat box, I simply typed: **"Give me 5 important questions."**
4. As you can see, the AI read my document and gave me five specific questions directly from the cheat sheet, such as **"How do I initialize a new Git repository?".**

**Generate Quiz**


To test your understanding, select the **"Generate Quiz"** tool. This opens the "Quiz Generator," where you can choose the number of questions with the help of a slider and select one of four quiz formats to begin. \
Let's look at each one.



1. **Multiple-Choice Quiz: \
**This is your classic quiz style. As you can see in the picture, after I chose "Multiple-Choice," the app read my Git cheat sheet and created questions with four possible answers (a, b, c, d). I just had to select the correct one.



<p id="gdcalert8" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image8.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert9">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image8.png "image_tooltip")


2. **True/False Quiz: \
**The "True/False" option is perfect for testing your attention to detail. The app generates several statements based on your document, like the one about the `git init` command you see in the image. You then simply review each statement and determine if it is true or false.



<p id="gdcalert9" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image9.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert10">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image9.png "image_tooltip")




3. **Fill-in-the-Blanks Quiz: \
**The **"Fill-in-the-Blanks"** quiz is perfect for memorizing key terms. It takes an important sentence from your notes and leaves a word out, just like in the picture where you have to recall the `git clone` command.



<p id="gdcalert10" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image10.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert11">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image10.png "image_tooltip")




4. **Short Answer: \
**The "Short Answer" quiz is a true test of your knowledge because there are no hints. It asks a direct question from your document, and you have to type the answer from scratch. Afterwards, the app shows the correct answer so you can check how you did.



<p id="gdcalert11" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image11.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert12">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image11.png "image_tooltip")


**Generate Flashcards**

The** "Generate Flashcards"** feature, which is perfect for active recall and memorization. Here are the key points:



* **Simple to Create:** You just use the slider to choose how many flashcards you want the AI to create from your document.
* **Interactive Studying:** The app generates a set of digital flashcards with a key term on one side and its definition on the other.
* **Click to Flip:** As the image shows, you can click on any card to flip it over. This lets you easily test yourself on the key concepts from your notes.



<p id="gdcalert12" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image12.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert13">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>
